// hours spent: 25

// Technical Tilt:
// one of the main reasons why i don't enjoy endless runners as much as other genres is they sometimes feel empty,
// and redudnant. I wanted the player to have to do more than just "dodge obstacles" so I tried to make most of the gameplay
// around the "rapping" mechanic so they have an actual objective to focus on and the 'running' aspect is a bit secondary.
//
// Creative Tilt:
// If there was something I can improve upon in the nedxt project, it would be time management on asset creation. I am very proud of
// all the assets I created, especially both character sprites, although they are simple frame wise the 8 bit art style especially on iceman
/// took a lot of time and I'm happy hopw they turned out. I also learned a decent amount about CSS styling with inset and outsets as well
// as scaling the screen although my full screen button did not end up being functional. I also made the music using an AKAI MPK MINI.
